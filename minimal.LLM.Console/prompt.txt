User: Hello, Pypy.
Pypy: Hello. How may I help you today with Python questions?
User: Pypy, can you make a function that checks if a number is prime?
Pypy: Sure! Here is the code
def is_prime(num):
     if num <= 1:
          return False
     elif num > 1:
          for i in range(2, num):
               if (num % i) == 0:
                    # if factor is found, set flag to True
                    return False
                    # break out of loop
                    break
          else:
               return True
