1 Every person must act in good faith in the exercise of his or her
rights and in the performance of his or her obligations.

1 Where the law makes a legal effect conditional on the good faith of a
person, there shall be a presumption of good faith.

believe that there are grounds for annulment.146
2 If the marriage has been otherwise dissolved, the authority may no
longer seek an annulment ex officio; however, any interested party
may seek a declaration of annulment.
3 An action for annulment may be brought at any time.
Art. 107
A spouse may seek a declaration of annulment if he or she:
1. temporarily lacked capacity of judgement at the time of the
wedding;
2. married in error, whether because he or she did not wish to
marry at all or did not wish to marry the other person;
3. contracted the marriage because he or she was intentionally
deceived with regard to essential personal attributes of the
other spouse;

1 An action for annulment must be brought within six months of
learning of the grounds for annulment or of the date on which the
threat ceased, but in any event within five years of the wedding.
2 The right to bring an action for annulment does not pass to heirs;
however, an heir may continue an action already brought.
Art. 109
1 A marriage does not become invalid until a court has declared it
annulled; prior to such judgment it has all the effects of a valid marriage with the exception of claims under inheritance law, which in any
event the surviving spouse loses.
2 The provisions governing divorce apply mutatis mutandis to the
effects of a court declaration of annulment on the spouses and their
children.
3 The presumption of paternity in favour of the husband does not
apply if the marriage is annulled because it served to circumvent the
provisions on the admission and residence of foreign nationals.148

period of two years; if an action is brought to recover rent due, he or
she is entitled to set off the amount paid in instalments equal to the
amount of the monthly rent against any maintenance payments owed
to the other spouse.
3 If the home belongs to the family of one of the spouses, the court
may, on the same conditions, grant the other spouse a right of residence for a fixed term in return for reasonable compensation or set-off
against maintenance payments. Where new and compelling reasons so
require, such right of residence may be restricted or revoked.
Art. 122159
In the event of divorce, any occupational pension assets accrued
during the marriage up to the point at which divorce proceedings
commence are divided equitably.
Art. 123160

2 The provisions on the equitable division of termination benefits
apply mutatis mutandis.
3 The Federal Council determines in which cases the amount under
paragraph 1 may not be applied in the division because there has been
a reduction due to over-compensation.
Art. 124a164
1 If, at the point at which divorce proceedings commence, a spouse is
drawing an invalidity pension after the statutory retirement age or
drawing a retirement pension, the court decides at its own discretion
how the pension is to be divided. In doing so it primarily takes into
account the duration of the marriage and the pension requirements of
each spouse.
2 The share of the pension awarded to the spouse entitled thereto is
converted into a life-long pension. This is paid to the entitled spouse
by the liable spouse’s occupational pension fund or is transferred to
the entitled spouse’s own occupational pension fund.
3 The Federal Council regulates:
1. the actuarial conversion of the share of the pension into a lifelong pension;
2. the procedure in cases in which the retirement benefits are
postponed or the invalidity pension is reduced due to overcompensation.
Art. 124b165
1 The spouses may, in an agreement on the consequences of the divorce, agree not to divide the assets equally or not to divide them at all
if there are sufficient retirement pension and invalidity pension funds
otherwise.
2 The court may award the entitled spouse less than half of the termination benefits or rule that they should not be divided if good cause
exists. Good cause exists above all when equal division would be
unreasonable:
1. in view of the division of marital property or the economic
circumstances following divorce;
2. in view of the pension requirements, in particular with regard
to the difference in age between the spouses.

3 The court may award the entitled spouse more than half of the termination benefits if he or she cares for joint children following the
divorce and the liable spouse continues to have sufficient retirement
and invalidity pension assets.
Art. 124c166
1 The spouses’ mutual entitlements to termination benefits or a share
of a pension are offset. The pension entitlement is offset before the
share of the pension awarded to the entitled spouse is converted into a
life-long pension.
2 Termination benefits may only be offset against a share of a pension
if the spouses and the occupational pension institutions agree.
Art. 124d167
If, having considered the pension requirements of both spouses, an
equitable division of occupational pension assets is unreasonable, the
liable spouse shall owe the entitled spouse a lump sum payment.
Art. 124e168
 1 If the equitable division of pension fund assets is not possible, the
liable spouse shall owe the entitled spouse adequate compensation in
the form of a lump sum payment or as a pension.
2 A Swiss judgment may be amended at the request of the liable
spouse if pension entitlements existing abroad have been offset by
adequate compensation pursuant to paragraph 1 and such pension
entitlements are then divided up in a foreign decision that is binding
on the foreign party liable to pay pension contributions.
Art. 125
1 If a spouse cannot reasonably be expected to provide for his or her
own maintenance, including an appropriate level of retirement provision, the other spouse must pay a suitable contribution.
2 In deciding whether such a contribution is to be made and, if so, in
what amount and for how long, the following factors in particular
must be considered:
1. the division of duties during the marriage;

the likely cost of reintegration into working life;
8. expectancy of federal old age and survivor’s insurance benefits and of occupational or other private or state pensions, including the expected proceeds of any division of withdrawal
benefits.
3 Exceptionally, a maintenance contribution may be denied or reduced
if it would clearly be inequitable, particularly because the spouse
otherwise entitled to receive such contribution:
1. has grossly neglected his or her duty to contribute to the
maintenance of the family;
2. has wilfully brought about his or her own indigence;
3. has committed a serious criminal offence against the other
spouse or a person close to him or her.
Art. 126
1 The court shall fix an amount to be paid periodically by way of
maintenance contribution and set the date on which the duty of
maintenance commences.
2 Where justified in specific circumstances, a lump sum settlement
may be ordered instead of regular payments.
3 The court may attach conditions to the maintenance contribution.
Art. 127
The spouses may wholly or in part exclude any alteration of the regular maintenance payments stipulated in the agreement.

the periodic maintenance payments may be reduced, cancelled or
suspended for a certain time; an improvement in the circumstances of
the party entitled to maintenance may be taken into account only if the
payments stipulated in the divorce decree provided sufficient maintenance.
2 The party entitled to maintenance may request that the payments be
adjusted in line with future inflation if the income of the other party
has increased unexpectedly since the divorce.
3 Within five years of the divorce, the party entitled to maintenance
may request that payments be ordered or increased provided the
divorce decree states that it was not possible at that time to order
sufficient maintenance payments and provided the economic circumstances of the party obliged to pay maintenance have since improved.
Art. 130
1 The duty to pay maintenance expires on the death of either the
receiving party or the paying party.
2 Unless otherwise agreed, it likewise expires on the remarriage of the
party entitled to receive maintenance.
Art. 131169
1 Where the liable party fails to pay maintenance, an official agency
designated by cantonal law shall on request, in an appropriate way and
usually without charge, assist the party entitled to maintenance to
enforce his or her claims.
2 The Federal Council determines the terms of enforcement assistance.
Art. 131a170
1 Public law may provide for advance payments to be made should the
liable person fail to make the necessary maintenance payments.
2 If the state authority makes maintenance payments to the entitled
person, the maintenance entitlement with all rights is assigned to the
state authority.

entitled to maintenance.
2 If the party obliged to pay maintenance persistently fails to do so, or
if there are grounds to suspect that said party is preparing to abscond
or is dissipating or concealing his assets, the court may order him to
post appropriate security for future maintenance contributions.

with the provisions on the legal effects of the parent-child relationship.
In particular it regulates:

paid after the child reaches the age of majority.
Art. 134
1 At the request of either parent, the child or the child protection
authority, new arrangements for parental responsibility shall be made

business is significantly greater than required in the light of the latter’s
contribution to the maintenance of the family, he or she is entitled to

their differences; if the spouses consent, experts may be consulted or
they may be referred to a marriage guidance or family counselling
agency.

payable to the spouse who looks after the household, cares for the
children or supports the other’s career or business.
3 Payments may be claimed for the future and for one year preceding
the request.
Art. 174
1 If a spouse exceeds his or her power to represent the marital union or
proves incapable of exercising it, at the other spouse’s request the
court may revoke such power in whole or in part.
2 The spouse making such request may inform third parties of the
revocation only by communications in person.
3 The revocation is effective towards third parties acting in good faith
only if it has been made public by order of the court.

Art. 203
1 The marital property regime does not affect the maturity of debts
contracted between spouses.
2 However, if payment of debts or the restitution of objects owed by a
spouse would cause him or her serious difficulties which might endanger the marital union, such spouse may request a time limit within
which to satisfy the claim; the claim is to be secured where reasonable
in the circumstances.

Art. 206
1 Where a spouse has contributed to the acquisition, improvement or
preservation of an asset belonging to the other without receiving
equivalent compensation, and where at the time of the liquidation that
asset has increased in value, then his or her claim corresponds to his or
her proportionate contribution and is calculated according to the
current value of the asset; if, conversely, the asset has decreased in
value, his or her claim corresponds to the original contribution.
2 If such an asset had already been alienated beforehand, the claim is
calculated according to the proceeds obtained and is due immediately.

increased value or vary the proportion thereof.

Art. 208
1 The following are added to the property acquired during marriage:
1. the value of dispositions made without consideration by one
spouse without the other’s consent during the five years preceding the dissolution of the marital property regime, save for
the usual occasional gifts;

Art. 209
1 Where debts incurred in connection with acquired property have
been paid out of individual property or where debts incurred in connection with individual property have been paid out of acquired property, there is a claim for compensation when the marital property
regime is liquidated.
2 A debt encumbers the property in relation to which it was incurred,
and in the event of doubt, it encumbers the acquired property.
3 If assets belonging to one category of property have contributed to
the acquisition, improvement or preservation of assets belonging to
the other and if the value of the latter has increased or diminished, the
claim for compensation corresponds to the proportionate contribution
made and is calculated according to the value of the assets at the time
of the liquidation or their disposal.
Art. 210
1 The remaining total value of the acquired property, including the
assets added in and claims for compensation, and after deduction of
the debts encumbering the acquired property, constitutes the surplus.

makes a justified claim for undivided allocation is stated at its capitalised value when calculating the proportionate added value and the
claim for participation.
2 The owner of the agricultural enterprise or his or her heirs may bring

or those of the issue of such children.
Art. 217
In the case of divorce, separation, annulment of marriage or separation
of property by court order, agreements varying the statutory participation in the surplus are valid only if the marital property agreement
expressly so provides.
Art. 218
1 If immediate payment of the participation claim and the share of the
increased value would cause serious difficulties for the debtor, he or
she may request a deferral.
2 Unless otherwise agreed by the spouses, the participation claim and
the share of the increased value bear interest as of completion of the
division of property and, where justified in the circumstances, security
must be furnished.
Art. 219
1 To ensure that the surviving spouse may maintain his or her accustomed lifestyle, at his or her request he or she will be granted a usufruct of or a right of residence in the home in which the spouses lived
and which belonged to the deceased spouse, and this will be set off
against his or her entitlement, subject to any contrary provision in the
marital agreement.
2 On the same conditions, he or she may request that ownership of the
household effects be transferred to him or her.
3 Where justified in the circumstances, at the request of the surviving
spouse or the other legal heirs of the deceased spouse, ownership of
the home may be granted rather than a usufruct or right of residence.
4 The surviving spouse may not claim such rights in respect of premises in which the deceased practised a profession or ran a business and
which are required by one of his or her issue in order to continue said
profession or business, subject to the provisions of agricultural inheritance law.

up to the amount of the shortfall.

or his or her heirs learn of the infringement of their rights, but in any
event ten years after the dissolution of the marital property regime.

inheritance law apply mutatis mutandis.196
Chapter Three: Community of Property
Art. 221
The marital property regime of community of property comprises the
common property and the individual property of each spouse.
Art. 222
1 The general community of property combines the assets and income

210
Art. 240
For the purpose of valuing the common property at hand at the time of
the dissolution of the marital property regime, the defining juncture is
the time of the division.
Art. 241
1 If the community of property regime is dissolved by the death of a
spouse or the implementation of a different marital property regime,
each party or his or her heirs is entitled to one-half of the common
property.
2 A different method of division may be agreed by marital agreement.
3 Such agreements must not adversely affect the statutory inheritance
entitlements of the spouse’s issue.
Art. 242
1 On divorce, separation, annulment of the marriage or separation of
property by law or court order, each spouse shall take back from the
common property such property as would have been his or her individual property under the participation in acquired property regime.
2 The remaining common property is divided equally between the
spouses.
3 Agreements to vary the statutory method of division are valid only if
the marital agreement expressly so provides.
Art. 243
If the community of property is dissolved by the death of a spouse, the
surviving spouse may request that such property as would have been
his or her individual property under the participation in acquired
property regime be allocated to him or her and count toward his or her
share of the estate.
Art. 244
1 If the home in which the spouses lived or any household effects
belong to the common property, the surviving spouse may request that
such property be allocated to him or her and count toward his or her
share of the estate.
2 Where justified in the circumstances, at the request of the surviving
spouse or the other legal heirs of the deceased spouse, a usufruct or
right of residence may be granted in lieu of ownership.

Art. 245
If a spouse demonstrates an overriding interest, he or she may also
demand that other assets be allocated to him or her and count toward
his or her share.
Art. 246
In other respects the provisions governing the division of property in
co-ownership and the division of estates apply mutatis mutandis.
Chapter Four: Separation of Property
Art. 247
Within the limits of the law, each spouse shall administer and enjoy
the benefits of his or her own property and has power of disposal over
it.
Art. 248
1 Any person who asserts that a specific object or asset is owned by
one or other spouse bears the burden of proof.
2 If no such proof may be adduced, there is a presumption of coownership.
Art. 249
Each spouse is liable for his or her debts with all his or her property.
Art. 250
1 The marital property regime does not affect the maturity of debts
contracted between spouses.
2 However, if payment of debts or the restitution of objects owed by a
spouse would cause him or her serious difficulties which might endanger the marital union, such spouse may request to be granted a
time limit in which to satisfy the claim; the claim is to be secured
where reasonable in the circumstances.

2 If the husband dies, he is deemed to be the father provided the child
is born within 300 days of his death or, if born thereafter, if it is
shown that the child was conceived before the husband’s death.
3 If the husband has been declared presumed dead, he is deemed to
have been the father provided the child is born within 300 days of the
life-threatening event or the last sign of life.
Art. 256205
1 The presumption of paternity may be challenged in court:
1. by the husband;
2.206 by the child if the spouses cease living together while the child
is still a minor.
2 The husband’s challenge is directed against the child and the mother,
that of the child against the husband and the mother.
3 The husband has no right of challenge if he consented to impregnation by a third party. The child’s right to challenge paternity is subject
to the Reproductive Medicine Act of 18 December 1998207.208
Art. 256a209
1 If a child was conceived in wedlock, the challenging party must
show that the husband is not the father.
2 The child is presumed to have been conceived in wedlock if it was
born no earlier than 180 days after the wedding and no later than
300 days after the marriage was dissolved as a result of death.210
Art. 256b211
1 If a child was conceived before the marriage was concluded or at a

2 However, in such cases the paternity of the husband is still presumed
where the court is satisfied that he had sexual intercourse with the
mother around the date of the conception.
Art. 256c212
1 The husband must file the challenge within one year of learning of
the birth and of the fact that he is not the father or that another man
had sexual intercourse with the mother around the date of the conception, but in any event not later than five years after the birth.
2 The child’s challenge must be filed at the latest within one year of
attaining the age of majority.213
3 Once these time limits have expired, a challenge of paternity is
admissible provided there is good cause for the delay.
Art. 257214
1 Where a child was born within 300 days of the dissolution of the
marriage as a result of death and the mother has since remarried, the
second husband is deemed to be the father.215
2 If this presumption is disproved, the first husband is deemed to be
the father.
Art. 258216
1 If the husband died or lost capacity of judgement before the time
limit expired, his father or his mother may challenge his paternity.
2 In this case the provisions governing a challenge by the husband
apply mutatis mutandis.

on the date on which the father or mother learns of the husband’s
death or loss of capacity of judgement.

1 Where the parent-child relationship exists only with the mother, the
father may recognise the child.
2 Where the recognising person is a minor or subject to a general
deputyship or if the adult protection authority has issued a related
order, recognition requires the consent of his or her legal representative.221
3 Recognition is effected by means of a declaration made before the
civil registrar or by testamentary disposition or, if an action to declare
paternity is pending, by a declaration made to the court.

Art. 260a222
1 Recognition may be challenged before the courts by any interested
party, namely the mother, the child or, after its death, its issue, and by
the commune of origin or domicile of the recognising person.
2 The recognising person is entitled to file a challenge only if he or she
recognised the child under threat of imminent and substantial risk to
his or her own life, limb, reputation or property or to those of a person
close to him or her, or in the erroneous belief that he was the father.
3 The challenge is directed against the recognising person and the
child, insofar as they themselves are not the challenging persons.
Art. 260b223
1 The challenging person must prove that the recognising person is not
the child’s father.
2 However, mother and child are only required to prove this if the
recognising person may satisfy the court that he had sexual intercourse
with the mother around the time of the child’s conception.
Art. 260c224
1 The challenge must be filed within one year of the date on which the
claimant learned of the recognition and the fact that the recognising
person is not the father, or that another man had sexual intercourse
with the mother around the time of the conception, or on which he or
she learned of his or her error or on which the threat ceased, but in any
event within five years of the recognition.
2 In all cases, the child may file the challenge at any time prior to the
elapse of one year after attaining the age of majority.225

admissible provided there is good cause for the delay.

2 The action is brought against the father or, if he has died, in order of
priority against his issue, parents or siblings or, where none exist,
against the competent authority of his last domicile.
3 If the father has died, the court must inform his wife that the action
has been brought so that she may safeguard her interests.
Art. 262227
1 If the defendant had sexual intercourse with the mother during the
period between the 300th day and the 180th day before the child’s birth,
his paternity is presumed.
2 Paternity is also presumed even if the child was conceived prior to
the 300th day or after the 180th day prior to birth provided the defendant had sexual intercourse with the mother during the period in which
the child was conceived.
3 There is no such presumption if the defendant shows that his paternity is either impossible or less probable than that of another man.
Art. 263228
1 The action is admissible both before and after the birth but must be
brought:
1. by the mother within one year of the birth;
2.229 by the child at any time prior to the elapse of one year after
attaining the age of majority.
2 If a parent-child relationship already exists with another man, the
action may in any event be brought within one year of the date on
which said relationship is annulled.
3 Once these time limits have expired, an action for determination of
paternity is admissible provided there is good cause for the delay.

other good cause. If the child is at least twelve years of age, a change
of name requires his or her consent.
2 The name of the child is determined in accordance with the provisions governing the legal effects of the parent-child relationship.
These apply mutatis mutandis to the adoption of the child by the
registered partner of its mother or father.
3 The competent authority may authorise an adult to be adopted to
continue using his or her existing name if there are good reasons for
doing so.
4 The change of name of an adult to be adopted does not affect the
naming of persons whose name is derived from the previous name of
the person to be adopted, unless they expressly agree to a change of
name.

minors continue to apply provided the requirements for adoption were
previously fulfilled.252
5 The adoption decision shall contain all the information required for
entry in the civil register relating to the first name, surname and citizenship of the adopted person.253
Art. 268a254
1 An application for adoption may not be upheld until all material
circumstances have been thoroughly investigated, where necessary in
consultation with the relevant specialists.
2 In particular, the investigation must look into the character and
health of the persons wishing to adopt and the child, their mutual
relationship, their suitability as parents, their financial situation, motives and family circumstances and the history of the child care relationship.255

Art. 273277
1 Parents not granted parental responsibility or whose children are not
resident with them are entitled to reasonable contact with their minor
children, and their children are entitled to contact with them.278
2 The child protection authority may remind parents, foster parents or
the child of their duties and issue them with instructions where the
exercise or failure to exercise contact entitlements is detrimental to the
child or where such reminder or direction is required for some other
reason.

mother so requests.
Art. 274279
1 The father and the mother must refrain from any conduct that impairs the child’s relationship with the other parent or makes the task of
the person with custody more difficult.280
2 Where contact with the child is not in its best interests, or the parents
breach their duties in the course of such contact or have not cared for
the child to any meaningful degree, or other good cause exists, the
parents’ right of contact with the child may be refused or withdrawn.
3 Where the parents have consented to the adoption of their child or
their consent may be dispensed with, their right of contact with the
child is extinguished as soon as the child is placed in foster care with a
view to future adoption.
Art. 274a281
1 In extraordinary circumstances, a right of contact with the child may
also be granted to other persons and in particular to relatives, to the
extent this serves the child’s best interests.

that of his or her place of temporary residence, insofar as the latter has
taken or is taking child protection measures.
2 If the court regulates parental responsibility, residence or the child
maintenance contribution in accordance with the provisions on the
divorce and protection of the marital union, it shall also regulate

2 The parents must, each according to their own abilities, provide for
the child’s maintenance, including the costs of caring for and raising
the child, his or her education and measures taken for his or her protection.289
3 The parents are released from their duty of maintenance to the extent
that the child may reasonably be expected to meet the costs thereof
from his or her own earnings or other resources.
Art. 276a290
1 The duty of maintenance towards a minor shall take precedence over
other maintenance duties under family law.
2 In justified cases, the court may disregard this rule, in particular in
order to prevent any disadvantage to a child entitled to maintenance
who is of age.
Art. 277291
1 The parents’ duty of maintenance lasts until the child attains the age
of majority.292
2 If at that juncture the child has not yet had a suitable education, the
parents must pay for his or her maintenance, to the extent conscionable in the overall circumstances, until such time as the child can complete a suitable education within the customary timescale.293
Art. 278294
1 For the duration of their marriage, the parents bear the costs of
maintenance in accordance with the provisions of marital law.
2 Each spouse must give the other all reasonable assistance in discharging the duty to maintain children born prior to the marriage.

child’s assets and income must be taken into account.
2 The child maintenance contribution also serves to ensure that the
child is cared for by the parents or by third parties.

Art. 285a300
1 Family allowance credits paid to the parent required to pay maintenance must be paid in addition to the maintenance.
2 Unless the court rules otherwise, any child allowance, social security
children’s supplement and similar child support benefits to which the
parent subject to the duty of maintenance is entitled must be paid in
addition to the child maintenance contribution.
3 Where as a result of old age or invalidity the parent subject to the
duty of maintenance subsequently receives social security, children’s
supplements or similar child support benefits which replace his or her
employment income, he or she must pay said benefits to the child; by
operation of law, his or her existing child maintenance contribution is
automatically reduced by the amount of such new benefits.

1 The court may order that the child maintenance contribution be
automatically increased or decreased in the event of specified changes
in the child’s needs, the parents’ financial resources or the cost of
living.
2 If circumstances change considerably, at the request of one parent or
the child the court will set a new level of child maintenance contribution or revoke it entirely.
3 Should the child have unforeseen, extraordinary needs the court may
order the parents to make a special financial contribution.303
Art. 286a304
1 If it was previously established in an approved maintenance agreement or a decision that no maintenance contribution could be set to
provide due maintenance for the child, and should the circumstances
of the parent liable to pay maintenance have since improved substantially, the child is entitled to claim payments that were not met by this
parent during the previous five years in which payments were owed to
provide due maintenance.
2 This claim must be brought within one year of it being known that
the circumstances have improved substantially.
3 This claim passes with all rights to the other parent or to the state
authority in as far as this parent or the state authority has met the
missing share of the due maintenance.
Art. 287305
1 Maintenance agreements are binding on the child only once they
have been approved by the child protection authority.
2 Child maintenance contributions stipulated in such agreements may
be modified, providing such changes have not been excluded with the
approval of the child protection authority.
3 If the agreement is concluded in court proceedings, such approval
must be given by the court.

Art. 287a306
Where maintenance contributions are set in a maintenance agreement,
the agreement must specify:
a. the income and assets of each parent and each child from
which the set amount is calculated;
b. the amount set for each child;
c. the amount required to cover any shortfall in the due maintenance of each child;
d. if and to what extent the maintenance contributions will be adjusted to reflect changes in living costs.
Art. 288307
1 Full and final settlement of the child’s maintenance entitlement may
be agreed if it is in the child’s best interests.
2 The settlement agreement becomes binding on the child only:
1. once the child protection authority or, in the case of an agreement reached during court proceedings, the court has approved
it, and
2. once the settlement amount has been paid into the account
designated in the approval.
Art. 289309
1 The right to child maintenance contributions is that of the child and,
so long as he or she is a minor, is fulfilled by payment to the child's
legal representative or to the person with whom the child resides,
unless the court decides otherwise.310
2 However, where the state authority assumes the cost of maintaining
the child, such claim and all attendant rights pass to the state authority.

2 If a parent who has sole parental responsibility dies, the child protection authority shall assign parental responsibility to the surviving
parent or if a legal guardian is appointed for the child, to the person
more suited to safeguarding the child's best interests.
Art. 298321
1 In divorce proceedings or proceedings to protect the marital union,
the court shall assign one parent sole parental responsibility if this is
necessary to safeguard the child's best interests.
2 It may limit itself to regulating residence, contact or sharing of
parenting duties if there is no prospect of the parents agreeing on these
matters.
2bis When regulating residence, contact and the sharing of parenting
duties it shall take account of the right of the child to maintain regular
personal relationships with both parents.322
2ter Where joint parental responsibility is awarded, with respect to the
child’s best interests, it shall consider the possibility of the child
residing with both parents on an alternating basis, if this is requested
by one of the parents or by the child.323
3 It shall request the child protection authority to appoint a legal
guardian for the child if neither the mother nor the father can be expected to accept parental responsibility.
Art. 298a324
1 If the parents are not married to each other and if the father recognises the child, or the parent-child relationship is established by court
judgment but joint parental responsibility was not ordered at the time
of the judgment, joint parental responsibility is established based on a
joint declaration by the parents.
2 In the declaration, the parents confirm that they:
1. are prepared to accept joint responsibility for the child; and
2. have agreed on residence and contact or on the sharing of parenting duties and on the child maintenance contribution for the
child.

action for payment of the maintenance contribution may be brought
before the competent court; in such a case the court also decides on

Art. 471430
The statutory entitlement is:
1. for any issue, three-quarters of their statutory succession
rights;
2. for each parent, one-half;

Art. 472432
Art. 473
1 By a testamentary disposition, the testator may grant the surviving
spouse a usufruct of the entire part of the estate passing to their common issue.433
2 This usufruct shall replace the statutory succession right due to the
spouse where the common issue are co-heirs with the spouse. In
addition to this usufruct, the disposable part is one-quarter of the
estate.434
3 If the surviving spouse remarries, the usufruct ceases to apply to that
part of the estate which, on succession, could not have been encumbered by a usufruct under the provisions ordinarily governing the
statutory entitlements of the deceased’s issue.435
Art. 474
1 The disposable part is calculated on the basis of the value of the
deceased’s assets at the time of his or her death.
2 In calculating this value, the deceased’s debts, the funeral expenses,
the costs of sealing and of drawing up the inventory and the maintenance claims of members of the household for one month are deducted
from value of the estate.

is added to the estate.
Art. 477
The testator has the power to deprive an heir of his or her statutory
entitlement by means of a testamentary disposition:
1.436 if the heir has committed a serious crime against the testator or
a person close to him or her;
2. if the heir has seriously breached his or her duties under family law towards the testator or the latter’s dependants.
Art. 478
1 The disinherited person may neither participate in the estate nor
bring an action in abatement.
2 Unless disposed of otherwise by the testator, the disinherited person’s portion passes to the testator’s statutory heirs as if the disinherited person had predeceased.
3 The disinherited person’s issue retain their statutory entitlements as
if he or she had predeceased.
Art. 479
1 A disinheritance is valid only if the testator indicates the reason for
the disinheritance in his or her testamentary disposition.
2 If the disinherited person challenges the disinheritance on the
grounds that the reason therefor is incorrect, any heir or legatee wishing to benefit from the disinheritance must prove that the reason is
correct.
3 Where no such proof may be adduced or no reason for the disinheritance is indicated, the disposition shall be upheld insofar as it does
not deprive the disinherited person of his or her statutory entitlement

testator, the latter may deprive the said issue of one-half of his or her
statutory entitlement providing he or she leaves that half to the existing or subsequently born children of the said issue.

the testator may dispose of it in part or in full by will or by contract of
succession.
2 Any property in respect of which no testamentary disposition has
been made passes to the statutory heirs.
Art. 482
1 The testator may attach burdens or conditions to the disposition, the
fulfilment of which may be requested by any interested party once the
disposition becomes effective.
2 Immoral or unlawful burdens or conditions render the disposition
null and void.
3 Where they are merely onerous to third parties or meaningless, they
are deemed not to exist.

Swiss Civil Code
145
210
2 Any disposition by which a beneficiary should receive all or a specified fraction of the deceased’s estate is deemed to constitute the naming of an heir.
Art. 484
1 The testator may bequeath a legacy to a beneficiary without naming
that person as an heir.
2 He or she may bequeath a specific legacy or the usufruct of the
whole or a part of the estate, or he or she may instruct the heirs or
other legatees to make payments to that person from the value of the
estate or to release that person from obligations.
3 If the testator bequeaths a specific legacy but the object is not part of
the estate and no other intention is evident from the disposition, no
obligation is placed on the obligor of the legacy.
Art. 485
1 The object must be delivered to the beneficiary in the same condition
that it was in on succession, including damage and growth and with or
without encumbrance.
2 With regard to expenditure on and deterioration of the legacy since
the succession, the obligor of the legacy has the same rights and duties
as an agent without authority.
Art. 486
1 Where the legacies exceed the value of the estate or of the bequest to
the obligor or of the disposable part, application may be made to have
them abated proportionately.
2 If the obligors do not survive the testator, are unworthy to inherit or
disclaim their inheritance, the legacies remain nonetheless effective.
3 If the testator has bequeathed a legacy to a statutory or named heir,
the latter has the right to claim the legacy even if he or she disclaims
his or her inheritance.
Art. 487
In his or her disposition, the testator may designate one or more persons to whom the estate or legacy shall pass in the event that the initial
heir or legatee is predeceased or disclaims it.

Art. 488
1 The testator is entitled in his or her dispositions to require the named
heir, as provisional heir, to deliver the estate to a third party, as remainderman.
2 No such obligation may be imposed on the remainderman.
3 The same provisions apply to legacies.
Art. 489
1 Except where the disposition stipulates otherwise, the time of delivery is deemed to be the death of the provisional heir.
2 Where a different time is specified and that time has not yet occurred
on the death of the provisional heir, the inheritance passes to his or her
heirs against security.
3 If for whatever reason that time may no longer occur, the inheritance
passes unreservedly to the heirs of the provisional heir.
Art. 490
1 In all cases in which remaindermen are designated, the competent
authority must order an inventory to be drawn up.
2 Delivery of the inheritance to the provisional heir is made only
against security, except where the testator has expressly released him
or her from such an obligation; in the case of immovable property,
security may be provided by entering the delivery obligation under
priority notice in the land register.
3 If the provisional heir is unable to provide security or jeopardises the
remainderman’s expectancy, the inheritance must be placed under
probate administration.
Art. 491
1 A provisional heir acquires the inheritance in the same manner as
any named heir.
2 He or she becomes the owner of the inheritance with an obligation to
deliver it.
Art. 492
1 The remainderman acquires the testator’s bequest if he or she is alive
at the stipulated delivery time.
2 If he or she dies before then, the inheritance passes to the provisional
heir unless the testator has ordered otherwise.

inheritance or disclaims the inheritance, it passes to the remainderman.
Art. 492a438
1 If any issue permanently lacks capacity of judgement and if he or she
is not survived by issue or a spouse, the testator may designate a
remainderman in respect of the residue.
2 The designation of the remainderman ceases to apply by law if the
issue, contrary to expectation, becomes capable of judgement.
Art. 493
1 The testator is entitled to bequeath all or part of the disposable
portion of his or her property to a foundation for any purpose of his or
her choosing.
2 However, the foundation is valid only if it conforms to the legal
requirements.
Art. 494
1 The testator may, by contract of succession, undertake to another
person to bequeath his or her estate or a legacy to that person or a third
party.
2 He or she is free to dispose of his or her property as he or she sees
fit.
3 However, testamentary dispositions or gifts that are incompatible
with obligations entered into under the contract of succession are
subject to challenge.
Art. 495
1 The testator may conclude an inheritance renunciation contract with
an heir with or without valuable consideration.
2 The renouncing party is not deemed to be an heir on succession.
3 Unless the contract provides otherwise, the renunciation of an inheritance also applies to the issue of the renouncing party.
Art. 496
1 Where certain persons are named in the renunciation contact as heirs
in lieu of the renouncing party, the renunciation is void if such persons
fail to acquire the inheritance for whatever reason.

438 Inserted by No I 2 of the FA of 19 Dec. 2008 (Adult Protection Law, Law of Persons and
Law of Children), in force since 1 Jan. 2013 (AS 2011 725; BBl 2006 7001).

2 Where an inheritance is renounced in favour of co-heirs, the renunciation is presumed to be effective only in respect of the heirs of the line
descending from their nearest common ascendant and has no effect
with regard to more distant heirs.
Art. 497
If the deceased was insolvent on succession and his or her creditors
are not satisfied by the heirs, the renouncing party and his or her heirs
may be held liable to the extent that they received valuable consideration for the renounced inheritance within the five years prior to the
death of the deceased and were still enriched by such consideration on
succession.
Section Four: Formal Requirements of Testamentary
Dispositions
Art. 498
The testator may make his or her will in the form of a public deed or
in holographic or oral form.
Art. 499

Art. 501
1 As soon as the public deed has been signed and dated, the testator

Art. 502
1 If the testator does not read and sign the deed, the official must read
it out in the presence of the two witnesses and the testator, who must
then declare that the deed contains his or her will.
2 In this case the witnesses must not only attest to the testator’s declaration and their judgment concerning his or her testamentary capacity
but must also confirm, by appending their signatures, that the deed
was read out to the testator by the official in their presence.
Art. 503
1 Persons who lack capacity to act, have been deprived of their civil
rights due to a criminal conviction439 or are unable to read or write,
lineal relatives440 or siblings of the testator or their spouses and the
testator’s spouse are not permitted to act as authenticating officials or

open or sealed, to an authority for safekeeping.
Art. 506
1 Where the testator is prevented from using any other form of will by
extraordinary circumstances such as the imminent risk of death,

439 The suspension of civil rights and privileges due to criminal conviction has been
abolished (see AS 1971 777; BBl 1965 I 561 and AS 1974 55; BBl 1974 I 1457). 440 Amended by No I 3 of the FA of 30 June 1972, in force since 1 April 1973

to make a will in oral form.
2 To do so, he or she must declare his or her will in the presence of
two witnesses and instruct them to have it drawn up as required in the
form of a deed.
3 The witnesses are subject to the same disqualification provisions as
apply to wills made in the form of public deeds.
Art. 507
1 The oral will, including the place, day, month and year, must be
written down immediately by one of the witnesses, then signed by
both and lodged without delay with a judicial authority together with a
declaration that the testator was in full possession of his or her testamentary capacity and that he or she informed them of his or her will in
the special circumstances prevailing at that time.
2 The two witnesses may instead have the will recorded by a judicial
authority along with the same declaration.
3 If the testator makes his or her oral will while on military service, an
officer with the rank of captain or higher may take the place of the
judicial authority.
Art. 508
If the testator subsequently has the opportunity to draw up his or her
will in another form, the oral will ceases to be valid 14 days after such
opportunity arises.
Art. 509
1 The testator may revoke his or her will at any time in one of the
forms envisaged for drawing it up.
2 Such revocation may apply to all or part of the will.

subsequently makes a new disposition of the same object that is incompatible with the previous disposition.
Art. 512
1 In order to be valid, a contract of succession must meet the same
formal requirements as a will executed as a public deed.
2 The contracting parties must simultaneously declare their intentions
to the public official and sign the deed before him or her and two
witnesses.

Section Five: Executors
Art. 517
1 In the will, the testator may appoint one or more persons with capacity to act to execute the will.

ex officio and they must state whether they accept it within 14 days of
such notification, silence being deemed tacit acceptance.
3 They are entitled to adequate recompense for their activities.
Art. 518
1 Unless otherwise provided by the testator, the executors have the
same rights and duties as an official estate administrator.
2 The executors’ function is to represent the testator’s wishes and, in
particular, to administer the estate, settle debts left by the testator,
distribute legacies and divide the estate in accordance with the testator’s instructions or as required by law.
3 Where more than one executor has been appointed, these powers are
exercised jointly, unless the testator has provided otherwise.
Section Six:
Declaration of Invalidity and Abatement of Dispositions
Art. 519
1 Where contested, a testamentary disposition may be declared invalid:
1. if it was made by the testator at a time when he or she lacked
testamentary capacity;
2. if it is the product of a lack of free will;
3. if its content or a condition attached to it is immoral or unlawful.

Art. 520
1 If the testamentary disposition is formally defective, it is declared
invalid on being contested before a court.
2 If the formal defect consists in the certain persons being party to the
execution of the disposition who or whose family members are beneficiaries under the testamentary disposition, only the clauses relating
to those beneficiaries shall be declared invalid.
3 The right of action is governed by the same provisions as apply in
the event of a lack of testamentary capacity.
Art. 520a444
If the formal defect in a holographic will consists in the day, month or
year not being indicated correctly or at all, the will may be declared
invalid only if the precise date cannot be ascertained in some other
manner and is necessary in order to determine the testator’s testamentary capacity, the chronological order of multiple wills or any other
issue affecting the validity of the will.
Art. 521
1 The right to bring an action of declaration of invalidity is subject to a
time limit of one year after the contesting party learned of the will and
the ground for nullity and in any event a maximum of ten years after
the commencement of probate proceedings.
2 In all cases, an action brought on grounds of lack of testamentary
capacity, immorality or unlawfulness against a beneficiary acting in
bad faith does not become time barred until 30 years have elapsed.
3 Invalidity may be invoked as a defence at any time.
Art. 522
1 Where the testator has exceeded his or her testamentary freedom,
those heirs who do not receive the full value of their statutory entitlement may sue to have the disposition abated to the permitted amount.
2 Clauses contained in testamentary dispositions relating to the entitlements of the statutory heirs are deemed merely to be instructions for
dividing the estate unless it is evident from the disposition that the
testator intended otherwise.

Art. 523
Where a testamentary disposition contains legacies in favour of several heirs with a statutory entitlement and the testator has exceeded his
or her testamentary freedom, such legacies shall be abated among the
co-heirs in proportion to the amounts by which they exceed each coheir’s statutory entitlement.
Art. 524
1 Where the testator has exceeded his or her testamentary freedom to
the detriment of an heir and the latter fails to bring a action in abatement despite being instructed to do so by the bankruptcy administrators or by creditors holding unpaid debt certificates on succession, the
administrators or creditors themselves may bring an action in abatement for the amount necessary to cover their claims within the same
time limit that applies to the heir.
2 The same right applies in the case of a disinheritance not contested
by the person disinherited.
Art. 525
1 Abatement is applied in equal proportion in respect of all named
heirs and legatees unless it is evident from the disposition that the
testator intended otherwise.
2 Where the abatement applies to a legacy whose beneficiary is also
the obligor of other legacies, subject to the same proviso such beneficiary may request that those other legacies be abated proportionately.
Art. 526
Where a specific legacy that cannot be divided without loss of value is
to be abated, the legatee may either claim it and pay the balance or
claim the disposable amount in lieu of the object.
Art. 527
The following are subject to abatement in the same manner as testamentary dispositions:
1. advances against a person’s share of an inheritance made in
the form of wedding gifts, settlements or assignments of assets, to the extent these are not subject to hotchpot;
2. compensation payments in settlement of future rights of inheritance;

1 A person acting in good faith has a duty of restitution only to the
extent that he or she is still enriched by such transactions with the
deceased at the time of succession.
2 Where benefits conferred under a contract of succession are subject
to abatement, the beneficiary is entitled to reclaim a proportionate
amount of the counter-performance made to the testator.
Art. 529
Where a life assurance claim maturing on the death of the deceased
was established in favour of a third party by a disposition inter vivos
or by a testamentary disposition or was transferred by the deceased
during his or her lifetime to a third party without valuable consideration, such claim is subject to abatement at its redemption value.
Art. 530
If the testator has encumbered the estate with rights of usufruct and
annuities such that their capitalised value over their probable duration
exceeds the disposable part of the estate, the heirs are entitled either to
seek proportionate abatement of such rights or to redeem them by
surrendering the disposable part of the estate to the beneficiaries.
Art. 531445
The naming of a remainderman in respect of an heir entitled to a
statutory entitlement is invalid as to that part of the estate; the provision on issue who are incapable of judgement is reserved.
Art. 532
Abatement applies first to testamentary dispositions and thereafter to

time.
Section Seven: Claims under Contracts of Succession
Art. 534
1 If the testator transfers his or her property during his or her lifetime
to the contractual heir, the latter may arrange for a public inventory to
be taken.
2 Where the testator has not transferred all his or her property or has
acquired property since the transfer, except where otherwise provided
the contract applies only to the property transferred.
3 Where such transfer takes place during the testator’s lifetime, except
where otherwise provided all rights and obligations arising from the
contract pass to the heirs of the named heir.
Art. 535
1 If the testator during his or her lifetime conferred benefits on a
renouncing heir that exceed that heir’s share of the estate, his or her
co-heirs may request abatement.
2 However, such benefits are subject to abatement only to the extent
they exceed the statutory entitlement of the renouncing heir.
3 Allowance is made for them according to the provisions governing
hotchpot.
Art. 536
If as a result of abatement a renouncing heir is obliged to reimburse
the estate, he or she has the choice of either taking the reimbursement
upon himself or of placing the entire benefit into hotchpot and participating in the division as if he or she had never renounced.

Art. 546
1 Where a person has been declared presumed dead, before his or her
heirs or legatees succeed to the estate, they must furnish security for
the restitution of the property to those with a prevailing claim or to the
missing person himself.
2 Such security shall be furnished for five years in the case of disappearance in life-threatening circumstances and for 15 years in the case
of absence without sign of life, but never beyond the date on which
the missing person would have become 100 years old.
3 The five-year period runs from the date on which the estate is transferred and the 15-year period from the last sign of life.
Art. 547
1 If the person who is presumed dead returns or other parties assert
prevailing claims to the estate, those put in possession of the estate
must return it according to the rules governing possession.
2 Provided they acted in good faith, they are liable to parties with
prevailing claims only during the period in which action may be
brought for reclamation of the estate.
Art. 548
1 If it is impossible to determine whether an heir is alive or dead when
succession commences because he or she has disappeared, his or her
share of the inheritance is placed under official administration.
2 Those who would succeed to the missing heir’s share if he or she
were dead may request the court to declare the heir presumed dead
one year after his or her disappearance in life-threatening circumstances or five years after the last sign of life and, once such declaration has been made, may apply for release of their shares of his or her
inheritance.
3 Such shares are released according to the provisions governing
release to the heirs of persons presumed dead.
Art. 549
1 If the heirs of the person presumed dead are already in possession of
his or her property and an inheritance passes to him or her, his or her

released to them without need for a second declaration of presumed
death.

under official administration for ten years or more, or he or she would
have reached the age of 100, at the request of the competent authority
the declaration of presumed death is pronounced ex officio.
2 If no rightful heirs come forward during the public notice period, the
property of the person presumed dead passes to the state authority
with right to succeed or, if he or she was never resident in Switzerland, to the canton of origin.
3 The local authority or canton concerned has the same duty of restitution as those put in possession of the estate towards the person presumed dead and parties with prevailing claims.

cantonal law and normally must be completed within two months of
the death of the deceased.
3 Cantonal legislation may require that an inventory be drawn up in
other cases.
Art. 554
1 Estate administrators are appointed:
1. where such an appointment is in the best interests of an heir
who is permanently absent and without representation;
2. where none of the claimants may adequately establish his or
her succession rights or the existence of an heir is uncertain;
3. where not all heirs are known;
4. in special cases provided for by law.
2 Where the deceased had named an executor, administration of the
estate is entrusted to him or her.
3 Where the deceased was subject to a deputyship that covers asset
management, the deputy is responsible for administering the estate
unless other instructions apply.453
Art. 555
1 If the authority is uncertain as to whether the deceased is survived by
heirs or whether it is aware of all the heirs, the authority must by
appropriate public means call on all persons with succession rights to
come forward and claim them within one year.
2 If no such person comes forward during this time and if no heirs are
known to the authority, the estate passes to the state authority with
right to succeed, subject to any action for recovery of inheritance.

2 The public official by whom the will was recorded or with whom it
was deposited or any other person who had custody of the will or
found it among the personal effects of the deceased is personally
responsible on learning of the testator’s death for ensuring that the will
is submitted to the authority.
3 Once the will has been submitted, the authority must, where feasible
after hearing all interested parties, either release the estate to the
statutory heirs on a provisional basis or appoint estate administrators.
Art. 557
1 The testator’s will must be opened and read out by the competent
authority within one month of its submission.

Chapter Two: Vesting of the Estate
Art. 560
1 On the death of the deceased, the estate in its entirety vests by operation of law in the heirs.
2 Subject to the statutory exceptions, the deceased’s claims, rights of
ownership, limited rights in rem and rights of possession automatically pass to the heirs and the debts of the deceased become the personal
debts of the heirs.
3 Vesting in the named heirs takes effect retroactively from the date on
which succession commenced and the statutory heirs must relinquish
the estate to them according to the rules governing possession.
Art. 561454
Art. 562
1 The legatees have a personal claim against the obligors of their
legacies or, where no-one is specifically named as such, against the
legal or named heirs.
2 Unless otherwise provided by testamentary disposition, the claim
becomes due once the obligor has accepted the inheritance or is no
longer able to disclaim it.
3 If the heirs fail to fulfil their obligation, they may be sued for release
of the bequeathed property or, where the legacy pertains to performance of some action, for damages.
Art. 563
1 Where the bequest to the legatee is a usufruct or annuity or other
recurring benefit, unless otherwise stipulated, his or her claim is
determined according to the provisions of property law and the Code
of Obligations.
2 If the legacy is a life assurance claim maturing on the death of the
testator, the legatee is entitled to assert that claim directly.

2 The claims of the heir’s creditors rank equally with those of the
testator’s creditors, provided the heir acquired the inheritance without
reservation.
Art. 565
1 If, after the legacies have been distributed, the heirs pay debts of the
estate that were previously unknown to them, they are entitled to
reimbursement from the legatees of an amount corresponding to the
proportionate abatement of such legacies that the heirs could have
claimed.
2 However, the legatees may be held liable only in the amount by
which they are enriched at the time such reimbursement is demanded.
Art. 566
1 The legal and named heirs are entitled to disclaim the inheritance
passing to them.
2 There is a presumption of a disclaimer if at the time of his or her
death the deceased had been officially declared insolvent or was
manifestly insolvent.
Art. 567
1 The time limit for a disclaimer is three months.
2 For statutory heirs, this limit begins on the date on which they
learned of the death, unless they can show that they did not learn of
their succession rights until later, and for named heirs it begins on the
date on which they received official notification of the testator’s
disposition.
Art. 568
If an inventory has been drawn up as a precautionary measure, the
disclaimer time limit for all heirs begins on the date on which the
authority notified them that the inventory was complete.
Art. 569
1 If an heir dies before disclaiming or accepting an inheritance, the
right to disclaim passes to his or her heirs.

inheritance from the deceased heir expires.

1 An heir must declare his or her disclaimer orally or in writing to the
competent authority.
2 It must be unconditional and without reservation.
3 The authority keeps an official record of disclaimers.
Art. 571
1 If the heir fails to declare that he or she disclaims the inheritance
within the relevant time limit, he or she acquires it without reservation.
2 Where an heir has interfered in the affairs of the estate before expiry
of the disclaimer time limit or has acted in a manner not conducive to
administering the estate or maintaining the deceased’s business activities, or where he or she has appropriated or concealed objects belonging to the estate, he or she is no longer entitled to disclaim the inheritance.
Art. 572
1 Where the deceased has not made a testamentary disposition and one
of two or more heirs disclaims the inheritance, his or her share of the
estate passes to the other heirs as if he or she had predeceased.
2 Where the deceased has made testamentary disposition, any share of
the estate disclaimed by a named heir passes to the testator’s nearest
statutory heirs, unless other intentions on the part of the testator are
evident from the disposition.
Art. 573
1 Where the inheritance is disclaimed by all the nearest heirs, the
estate is liquidated by the bankruptcy office.
2 If liquidation produces a surplus after payment of debts, this passes
to those entitled to inherit as if they had not disclaimed it.

Art. 575
1 When disclaiming the inheritance, the heirs may request that it be
offered to their subsequent heirs before the estate is liquidated.
2 In this event, the authority informs the subsequent heirs that the
preceding heirs have disclaimed, and if the former fail to declare their
acceptance of the inheritance within one month, they are likewise
deemed to have disclaimed it.
Art. 576
Where there is good cause, the competent authority may grant the
legal and named heirs an extension of the time limit or set a new one.
Art. 577
Where a legatee disclaims a legacy, it becomes void in favour of the
obligor, unless other intentions on the part of the testator are evident
from his or her disposition.
Art. 578
1 Where an overindebted heir has disclaimed an inheritance in order to
withhold it from his or her creditors, the latter or the bankruptcy
administrators may challenge the disclaimer within six months unless
their claims are secured.
2 If their challenge is upheld, the inheritance is placed in official
liquidation.
3 Any surplus serves first to satisfy the challenging creditors and any
balance remaining after redemption of the other debts passes to the
heirs in whose favour the disclaimer was made.
Art. 579
1 Where the deceased was insolvent and his or her heirs disclaim the
inheritance, they remain liable to his or her creditors to the extent that
in the five years prior to his or her death they received property or
assets from him or her which on division of the estate would have
been subject to hotchpot.
2 The endowment of newly-weds according to local custom and the
costs of raising and educating children are not affected by such liability.

Chapter Three: Public Inventory
Art. 580
1 Any heir entitled to disclaim his or her inheritance has the right to
request a public inventory.
2 The request must be made to the competent authority within one
month in the same form as the disclaimer.
3 A request made by one heir is also valid for the others.
Art. 581
1 The public inventory is drawn up by the competent authority in
accordance with the provisions of cantonal law and consists of a list of
all the assets and debts of the estate, together with an appraisal of the
value of each item in the inventory.
2 Any person able to provide information on the financial circumstances of the deceased is personally obliged to give the authority all
the information it requires.
3 In particular, the heirs must inform the authority of any debts of the
deceased that are known to them.
Art. 582
1 In the course of drawing up the inventory, the authority shall make a
formal call to account whereby appropriate public notices are issued
calling on all creditors and debtors of the deceased, including creditors
under a surety, to come forward and register their claims and debts
within a specified time limit.

Art. 590
1 The heirs are not liable either personally or with the inheritance
towards creditors of the estate whose claims were not included in the
inventory because the creditors failed to register them in time.
2 Where such failure to register claims in the inventory was through no
fault of the creditor or his or her claims were not included in the
inventory despite having been registered, the heir is liable to the extent
he or she is enriched by the inheritance.
3 In all cases, creditors may assert claims to the extent these are secured by a lien on the estate assets.
Art. 591
Any debts under a surety given by the deceased are listed separately in
the inventory and may be asserted against an heir, even where he or
she accepts the inheritance, only in the amount that would be allocated
to the surety debt if all debts of the estate were to be redeemed under
the rules governing bankruptcy.
Art. 592
Where an estate passes to a state authority, a formal call to account is
made ex officio and the state authority is liable for the debts of the
estate only in the amount of the assets it has inherited from the estate.
Chapter Four: Official Liquidation
Art. 593
1 Rather than disclaim the inheritance or accept it subject to public
inventory, each heir is entitled to request official liquidation.
2 However, such request may not be granted if at least one co-heir
accepts the inheritance.
3 In the event of official liquidation, the heirs are not liable for the
debts of the estate.
Art. 594
1 Where the deceased’s creditors have good cause to fear that their
claims will not be met and such claims are not satisfied or secured at

1 The testator is entitled by means of testamentary disposition to give
his or her heirs instructions concerning the division and the formation
of portions.
2 Such instructions are binding on the heirs, subject to measures to
balance out the portions in the event of an inequality not intended by
the testator.
3 Unless other intentions on the part of the testator are evident from
his or her disposition, any bequest of a given part of the estate to one
particular heir is deemed to be merely an instruction concerning the
division rather than a specific legacy.
Art. 609
1 At the request of a creditor who has acquired or distrained an inheritance that has passed to an heir or who holds unpaid debt certificates
against him or her, the authorities must assist in the division in place
of that heir.

authority decides whether such auction is to be public or only among
the heirs.
Art. 612a457

household effects form part of the estate, the surviving spouse may
request that such property be allocated to him or her against his or her
portion.

spouse or the other statutory heirs of the deceased, a usufruct or right
of residence may be granted rather than ownership of the home.

which is physically undivided.
2 Unless otherwise stipulated, they are co-owners in equal measure.

co-owners, such measures as are urgently needed to safeguard
the object against imminent or incremental damage.
Art. 647a475
1 Each co-owner may attend to ordinary administration and in particular carry out repairs, sowing and harvesting, short-term custody and
supervision, may conclude contracts for such purposes and may exercise the powers derived from such contracts and from rental, lease,
work and service agreements, including the payment and acceptance
of monies on behalf of all the co-owners.

carry out administration may be submitted to a different regime,
subject to the statutory provisions governing necessary and urgent
measures.
Art. 647b476
1 By the consent of a majority of the co-owners together representing a
majority share in the object, major administrative acts may be carried
out, notably including changes in methods of cultivation or use, conclusion and termination of rental and lease agreements, participation
in land improvements and the appointment of an administrator whose
authority extends beyond ordinary administrative acts.
2 The provisions governing necessary construction work are reserved.
Art. 647c477

share in the object.
2 Alterations which permanently hinder or render unprofitable a coowner’s use or exploitation of the object for its existing purpose may
not be carried out without the consent of that co-owner.
3 Where an alteration would require a co-owner to bear unreasonable
costs, in particular because they are disproportionate to the value of
his or her share, the alteration may be carried out without his or her
consent only if the other co-owners assume such part of his or her
share of the costs as exceeds that which he or she may reasonably be
expected to meet.
Art. 647e479
1 Building works serving merely to embellish the object, improve its
appearance or make its use more comfortable or convenient may only
be carried out with the consent of all the co-owners.
2 If such works are commissioned with the consent of the majority of
the co-owners who also represent a majority share in the object, they
may be carried out even against the wishes of a dissenting co-owner
providing they do not permanently impair the latter’s right of use and
enjoyment and the other co-owners compensate him or her for the
merely temporary impairment and assume his or her share of the costs.
Art. 648480
1 Each co-owner is entitled to represent, use and exploit the object
insofar as is compatible with the rights of the other co-owners.
2 The alienation or encumbrance of the object and the modification of
its designated purpose require the consent of all co-owners, unless
they have unanimously agreed some other arrangement.
3 Where mortgage rights or real burdens apply to co-ownership shares,
the co-owners are not permitted to further encumber the object itself
with such charges.

1 A co-owner may be excluded from the community of co-owners by
court order if, as a result of his or her conduct or that of persons to
whom he or she granted use of the object or for whom he or she is
responsible, his or her duties towards the other co-owners individually
or collectively are so seriously violated that continuation of the community of co-owners becomes unreasonable.
2 Where the community comprises only two co-owners, each has the
right to sue the other; in other cases, unless otherwise agreed, legal
action against one co-owner must be authorised by a majority of all
the co-owners excluding the person to be sued.

him or her to alienate his or her share and, should he or she fail to do
so within the allowed time limit, shall order it to be sold at public

or sale at auction and division of the sale proceeds, or by transfer of
the entire object to one or more co-owners who buy out the others.

Title Nineteen: Land Ownership
Chapter One: Object, Acquisition and Loss of Land
Ownership
Art. 655492
1 The object of land ownership is all immovable property.
2 Within the meaning of this Code, immovable property includes:
1. parcels of land and the buildings thereon;
2. distinct and permanent rights recorded in the land register;
3. mines;
4. co-ownership shares in immovable property.
3 An easement relating to immovable property may be recorded in the
land register as an independent and permanent right if it:
1. is not created in favour of a benefited property nor exclusively
for a specific person; and
2. is established for at least 30 years or for an unlimited period.494
Art. 655a495
1 A parcel of land may be linked to another parcel of land such that the
owner of the main parcel of land is also the owner of the attached
parcel of land. The attached parcel shares the same legal destiny as the
main parcel and may not be alienated, pledged or encumbered separately.
2 If the parcels are linked for a permanent purpose, the statutory right
of pre-emption of the co-owners and the right to demand dissolution
may not be claimed.
Art. 656
1 The acquisition of land ownership must be recorded in the land
register.

2 In the case of appropriation, inheritance, compulsory purchase, debt
enforcement or court judgment, the acquirer becomes the owner even
before registration in the land register but obtains the power of disposal over the immovable property only once he or she has been recorded
as the owner in the land register.
Art. 657
1 In order to be binding, a contract to transfer land ownership must be
executed as a public deed.
2 Testamentary disposition and marital contracts require the forms
prescribed by the law of succession and marital property law.
Art. 658
1 Immovable property recorded in the land register may be appropriated only if the register establishes that it has no owner.
2 Appropriation of land not recorded in the land register is subject to
the provisions governing ownerless objects.
Art. 659
1 If new exploitable land is formed from previously ownerless land as
a result of alluvion, filling or ground displacement, changes in the
course or level of public waters or in some other manner, such land
belongs to the canton in which it lies.
2 The cantons are free to allocate such land to owners of adjoining
land.
3 If a person can show that parts of ground have become detached
from his or her property, he or she is entitled to take them back within
an appropriate period.
Art. 660
1 Ground displacement from one parcel of land to another does not
alter the boundaries of the parcels.
2 Earth and other objects moving from one parcel to the other in the
process are subject to the provisions governing driftage or the joining
and mixing of chattels.

Art. 660a497
1 The general principle whereby ground displacement does not alter
land boundaries does not apply to areas designated by the cantons as
being in permanent danger of ground displacement.
2 When designating such areas, due consideration shall be given to the
characteristics of the land in question.
3 Where a parcel of land forms part of such an area, this fact must be
notified in an appropriate manner to the interested parties and recorded in the land register.
Art. 660b498
1 If a land boundary is rendered impractical by ground displacement,
any affected landowner may request that it be redrawn.
2 Any loss or gain in value shall be balanced out.
Art. 661
Where a person has been wrongly recorded in the land register as the
owner of immovable property, his or her ownership may no longer be
challenged if he or she has been in possession of it in good faith,
uninterruptedly and without challenge for ten years.
Art. 662
1 Where a person has been in possession of immovable property not
recorded in the land register uninterruptedly and without challenge for
30 years as if it were his or her property, he or she has the right to be
registered as the owner.
2 The same right applies on the same conditions to a person in possession of immovable property whose owner is not evident from the land
register or who was declared dead or presumed dead at the beginning
of the 30-year adverse possession period.
3 However, such registration may be made only by court order on
expiry of a publicly notified period for objections, provided no such
objections have been raised or those raised have been dismissed.

canton on whose territory they are situated.
2 No rights of private ownership apply to public waters or to land not
suitable for cultivation, such as rocks and scree, firn and glaciers, or to
springs rising therefrom, unless proof to the contrary is produced.
3 The cantons shall enact the provisions required to govern the appropriation of ownerless land, exploitation and common use of public
objects such as roads, town and village squares, waterways and riverbeds.
Art. 665
1 By virtue of acquisition, the acquirer gains a personal claim against
the owner to be recorded in the land register and, should the owner
refuse, the right to have ownership awarded by court order.
2 In the case of appropriation, inheritance, compulsory purchase, debt
enforcement or court judgment, the acquirer may obtain such registration on his or her own initiative.
3 Changes to land ownership occurring by operation of law as a result
of marital community of property or the dissolution thereof shall be
recorded in the land register at the request of either spouse.499

his or her heirs is unknown, the court may on application order the
required measures.
2 The court may in particular appoint a representative. On application,

maintain the property.
3 The following may apply for measures to be ordered:
1. any person with a legitimate interest;
2. the land register at the location of the immovable property.
4 The ordering of measures does not interrupt the period required to
obtain extraordinary adverse possession.
Art. 666b501
If a legal entity or other rights holder that is recorded in the land
register as the owner no longer has the required management bodies,
and person with a legitimate interest or the land register at the location

canton as being in permanent danger of ground displacement.502
Art. 669
Every landowner is obliged, at the request of his or her neighbour, to
co-operate in establishing the boundary where it is unclear, whether by
amendment of the land register plans or by affixing boundary markers.
Art. 670
Where boundaries are marked by features such as walls, hedges and
fences, such features are presumed to be jointly owned by the two
neighbouring landowners.
Art. 671
1 Where a person uses materials belonging to another in building work
on his or her own land or materials of his or her own on land belonging to another, such materials become an integral part of the parcel of
land.
2 However, where such materials are used against the will of their
owner, the latter is entitled to demand that the materials be removed
and returned to him or her at the landowner’s expense to the extent
this is possible without causing disproportionate damage.
3 On the same condition, where the materials were used against the
will of the landowner, the latter may demand that they be removed
from his or her land at the expense of the builder.
Art. 672
1 Where the materials are not removed from the land, the landowner
must provide appropriate compensation for the cost of the materials.
2 Where the landowner on whose land the building work was carried
out acted in bad faith, the court may award full damages.

bad faith, the damages awarded may not exceed the minimum value of
the building work to the landowner.

Art. 674
1 Buildings and other structures encroaching from one parcel of land
onto another remain part of the parcel from which they originate,
providing their owner has a right in rem to their existence.
2 The right to encroach on neighbouring land may be recorded as an
easement in the land register.
3 If an injured party fails to object in timely manner to an unauthorised
encroachment, despite being aware of it, where justified in the circumstances the builder of the encroaching structure, provided he or she
acted in good faith, may be granted ownership of the encroaching part
thereof or of the land below it in exchange for appropriate compensation.
Art. 675
1 Buildings and other structures that are dug into or built onto land
belonging to another person or otherwise permanently connected with
that parcel of land on or below its surface may have a separate owner

cables and conduits belonging to another person is established by way
of easement.

1 Where a person uses another person’s plants on his or her own land
or his or her own plants on another person’s land, the same rights and

owner in the land register.
3 During that time a person may exercise a right of pre-emption
against any owner of the land.
Art. 681b512

in writing once the event that triggers it has occurred.
Art. 682513
1 Co-owners have a right of pre-emption against any person acquiring

existing shares.515
2 The owner of a parcel of land encumbered with a distinct and permanent building right shall also have a right of pre-emption in respect
of that right over anyone wishing to acquire it, and the holder of the
right has a right of pre-emption in respect of the parcel of land it
encumbers, providing the land is used in the exercise of his or her
right.

1 Overhanging branches and roots encroaching beyond the boundary
may be severed and kept by the neighbour if they are damaging his or
her property and have not been removed within a reasonable time
following his or her complaint in relation thereto.
2 If a landowner tolerates branches overhanging cultivated or developed land, he or she is entitled to the fruit that grows on them.
3 These provisions do not apply to adjoining parcels of woodland.
Art. 688
The cantons are authorised to set minimum separation distances for
plantations depending on the type of land and plants involved or to
oblige the landowner to permit the overhanging branches or encroaching roots of fruit trees and to regulate or annul his or her right to take
the fruit from such branches.
Art. 689
1 Every landowner is obliged to receive the waters flowing naturally
from a higher-lying parcel of land, such as rain water, melting snow
and water from unchannelled springs.
2 No person may alter the natural course of flow to his or her neighbour’s detriment.
3 Water flowing to a lower-lying parcel of land and required by that
property may be withheld only to the extent that such water is indispensable to the higher-lying parcel of land.
Art. 690
1 Where a higher-lying parcel of land is drained, the owner of lowerlying parcel of land is obliged to receive such water as previously
flowed naturally onto his or her land without being entitled to compensation.
2 If he or she suffers damage as a result of drainage channels, he or she
may require the owner of the higher-lying parcel of land to continue
such channels through the lower-lying parcel of land at the latter’s
expense.

2 The right for pipes, cables and conduits to traverse an adjoining
parcel of land may not be claimed on the basis of the law of neighbours in cases subject to compulsory purchase under cantonal or
federal law.
3 At the request of the dominant or the servient owner, such rights
shall be recorded in the land register as an easement at the expense of
the dominant owner. The right for pipes, cables and conduits to traverse an adjoining parcel of land may be cited in opposition to a person
acquiring a parcel of land in good faith, even if it is not registered.523
Art. 692
1 The servient owner is entitled to just and equitable consideration of
his or her own interests.
2 Where justified by extraordinary circumstances, he or she may
request that the piece of the land above which overhead pipes, cables
and conduits are to be routed together with a reasonable portion of the
surrounding land be purchased from him or her at its full value.
Art. 693
1 If circumstances change, the servient owner may request that the
route of the pipe, cable or conduit be altered in accordance with his or
her interests.
2 The costs of such re-routing are normally borne by the owner of the
dominant property.
3 However, where justified by special circumstances, an appropriate
portion of the costs may be charged to the servient owner.

The cantons reserve the right to enact more detailed provisions which
govern the landowner’s right to enter neighbouring land for the purposes of managing his or her own land or carrying out repairs or
building works and which regulate rights of way for the purpose of
tillage, watering cattle, transit over fallow ground or in the dead season, transit for timber gathering, and the like.

from himself or herself or others only by trespassing on land belonging to another, the latter is obliged to tolerate such trespass to the
extent that such danger or damage would be considerably greater than
the detriment caused by the trespass.
2 Appropriate compensation is owed for any resultant damage.
Art. 702
The Confederation, cantons and communes reserve the right to impose
restrictions on ownership that are in the public interest, and in particular that relate to building, fire and health regulations, forestry and road
services, towpaths, erection of boundary markings and triangulation
pillars, land improvements, fragmentation of landholdings, consolidation of agricultural land and building land, conservation of antiquities
and natural monuments, preservation of areas of natural beauty and
scenic vantage points and protection of mineral springs.

1 Where it is possible to carry out land improvements, such as watercourse modifications, drainage, irrigation, reforestation, path-building,
land consolidation procedures and the like, only by collective endeavour and such endeavour has been approved by the majority of the
landowners owning more than half of the land involved, the other
landowners are obliged to participate. Landowners who choose not to
participate in the decision-making process are deemed to consent.
Participation is recorded in the land register.
2 The cantons regulate the procedure. In particular, they must issue
detailed rules on consolidation of landholdings.
3 Cantonal legislation may further facilitate the realisation of such land
improvements and may declare that the corresponding provisions also
apply to building land and to areas designated as being in permanent
danger of ground displacement.525

Art. 706
1 Where springs and wells that enjoy considerable use or whose waters
are collected for further use are cut off, diminished or contaminated by
building works, installations or other measures to the detriment of
their owners or rightful users, such persons are entitled to claim damages.
2 Where the damage was done neither intentionally nor through negligence, or the injured parties are themselves at fault, the court determines the amount and manner of compensation at its discretion.
Art. 707
1 If springs and wells that are indispensable for the exploitation or
habitation of a parcel of land or for the supply of drinking water are
cut off or contaminated, those affected have the right to demand that
the status quo ante be restored where at all possible.
2 In other cases restoration of the status quo ante may be demanded
only where this is justified by special circumstances.
Art. 708

requirements and if such water cannot be obtained from anywhere else
except at an entirely disproportionate cost and effort, the owner may
request that a neighbour able to spare such water without suffering
hardship allow him or her a share of the latter’s spring or well to him
or her in exchange for full compensation.
2 When determining which water source is thus affected, the interests
of the person required to supply the water are the primary consideration.

place may be requested.

Chapter Three:526 Condominium
Art. 712a
1 Condominium is a form of co-ownership of immovable property that
gives the co-owner the exclusive right to make sole use of specific
parts of a building thereon and design the interior of such parts.
2 Each condominium owner is free to manage, use and design the
structure of his or her own parts of the building as he or she wishes but
must not obstruct any other condominium owners in the exercise of
their own rights or in any way damage the common parts of the building, fittings and installations or impair their functional effectiveness or
appearance.
3 Each condominium owner is obliged to maintain his or her parts of
the building in the manner required to preserve the sound condition
and good appearance of the building as a whole.
Art. 712b
1 The object of the exclusive right may be individual storeys or parts
of a storey which must be self-contained with their own access and
used either as dwellings or as self-contained units of rooms used for
business or other purposes, although separate ancillary rooms are
allowed.
2 The condominium owner may not be granted an exclusive right to
the following:
1. the land on which the building stands and the building right by
virtue of which it is constructed;
2. the parts of the building that are vital to the soundness, structure and stability of the building as a whole or of the units of
other condominium owners or that determine the outward
form and appearance of the building;
3. the fittings and installations that also serve the other condominium owners in the use of their units.
3 The deed of constitution or a subsequent agreement among the
condominium owners executed in the same form may stipulate that
other parts of the building are common property, failing which they
are presumed to be the object of a exclusive right.

Art. 712c
1 Condominium owners do not by law have first right of refusal in
respect of a third party acquiring a share, but such right may be stipulated in the deed of constitution or by subsequent agreement and
entered under priority notice in the land register.
2 Similarly, it may be stipulated that the alienation, encumbrance with
usufruct or right of residence or letting of a unit is valid only if the
other co-owners do not object by resolution made within 14 days of
receiving notice of such transaction.
3 The objection is ineffective if made without good cause.527
Art. 712d
1 Condominium is constituted by entry in the land register.
2 Such entry may be requested:
1. on the basis of an agreement between the condominium owners to constitute their shares as condominium;
2. on the basis of a declaration by the owner of the property or
the holder of a distinct and permanent building right to form
shares in co-ownership and to constitute the same as condominium.
3 In order to be valid, the constitution of condominium must be executed in the form of a public deed or, where provided for in a testamentary disposition or in a contract of division of estate, in the form
prescribed by the law of succession.
Art. 712e
1 The deed of constitution must specify the manner in which the
property is divided into condominium units and define the share that
each unit represents of the value of the property or of the building
right expressed as fractions with a common denominator.529
2 Alteration of the size of a share requires the consent of all directly
involved parties and the approval of the assembly of condominium
owners; however, each condominium owner is entitled to seek rectification if his or her share has been defined incorrectly in error or is no

1 Condominium is extinguished on the loss of the property or the
building right and its deletion from the land register.
2 Such deletion may be requested in accordance with a termination
agreement or by a single condominium owner holding all the shares,
but it requires the consent of all persons with rights in rem to the
individual units which cannot be transferred to the property as a whole
without detriment.
3 Any condominium owner may request termination of the condominium where:
1. more than half the value of the building has been destroyed
and reconstruction would impose an onerous burden on him;
or
2. the building has been divided into condominium units for
more than 50 years and can no longer be used in accordance
with the regulations due to its poor structural condition.530
4 Condominium owners wishing to maintain the condominium may
prevent such termination by buying out the others.531

1 The provisions governing co-ownership regulate the authority to take
administrative action and instruct construction work.
2 Except where such provisions are mandatory, they may be replaced
by others set out in the deed of constitution or adopted by unanimous
resolution of the assembly of condominium owners.
3 Moreover, each condominium owner is entitled to request that a set
of rules governing administration and use be drawn up and noted in
the land register, such rules being binding once accepted by resolution
passed by a majority of the condominium owners who together represent more than one-half of the property and being subject to amendment by the same majority even if included in the deed of constitution.

Art. 712i
1 The community of condominium owners is entitled to establish a
lien on each condominium owner’s unit as security for his or her
portion of the shared costs over the previous three years.
2 Registration of the lien may be requested by the administrator or,

inform the owner or, if the latter is unknown, report his or her find.
2 The cantons designate the authority to which such finds must be
reported.
Art. 721
1 A find must be held in appropriate safekeeping.
2 If it requires expensive maintenance or is susceptible to rapid deterioration, or if the police or a public body has held it for more than one
year, it may be sold at public auction with the prior authorisation of
the competent authority.
3 The proceeds of sale at auction replace the object.
Art. 722
1 A person who has discharged his or her duties as finder acquires
ownership of the find if it has not been possible to trace the rightful
owner within five years of the announcement or public notice being
given of the find.
1bis In the case of animals kept as pets rather than for investment or
commercial purposes, the period is two months.536
1ter If the finder puts the animal in a home with the intention of renouncing its ownership, on expiry of the two-month period the animal
home is at liberty to dispose of the animal as it sees fit.537
2 If the find is returned to its owner, the finder is entitled to compensation for all outlays and to a suitable finder’s reward.
3 In the case of a find made in an occupied house or on premises used
for public services or public transport, the head of the household,
tenant or supervisor is deemed to be the finder but is not entitled to
any finder’s reward.

found.
3 The finder is entitled to an appropriate finder’s reward not exceeding
one-half of the treasure’s value.
Art. 724
1 Ownerless natural specimens and antiquities of scientific value are
the property of the canton on whose territory they are found.538
1bis Such objects must not be alienated without the consent of the
competent cantonal authorities. They may not be purchased in good
faith or acquired through adverse possession. There is no time limit on
the canton’s right to recover them.539
2 The owner of the land on which such objects are found is obliged to
permit their excavation in exchange for compensation for the damage
caused.
3 The finder, and in the case of treasure trove also the owner is entitled
to an appropriate finder’s reward not exceeding one-half of the value
of the find.
Art. 725
1 If chattels are carried onto a person’s property by water, wind, avalanche or other force of nature or by chance event, or if animals belonging to others stray onto his or her property, such a person has the
rights and obligations of the finder of a lost object.
2 If a swarm of bees flies into an occupied beehive belonging to another person, the owner of that hive acquires said swarm without
obligation to compensate.
Art. 726
1 If a person has processed or reworked an object that does not belong
to him, the newly created object becomes the property of that person if
the work is more valuable than the material, failing which it belongs to
the original owner.
2 Where the person doing such work did not act in good faith, the
court may award the newly created object to the original owner even if
his or her work is more valuable than the material.
3 Claims for damages and unjust enrichment are reserved.

such that they may no longer be separated without substantial damage
or prohibitive labour and expense, those involved acquire joint ownership rights in the new object in proportion to the value of the constituent parts at the time that they were mixed or joined.
2 If one chattel is mixed with or joined to another such that it acquires
the character of a secondary component of the latter, the entire object
belongs to the owner of the primary component.
3 Claims for damages and unjust enrichment are reserved.
Art. 728
1 If a person has possessed a chattel belonging to another person
uninterruptedly and without challenge for five years believing in good
faith that he or she owns it, he or she becomes its owner by adverse
possession.
1bis In the case of animals kept as pets rather than for investment or
commercial purposes, the period is two months.540

2 Involuntary loss of possession does not interrupt adverse possession
provided the possessor regains the chattel within one year or by means
of legal action brought within the same time limit.
3 The computation, interruption and suspension of adverse possession
time limits are governed mutatis mutandis by the provisions on the
time limitation of debts.
Art. 729
Even where possession has been lost, ownership of the chattel is not
extinguished until the owner relinquishes his or her right or until
another person subsequently acquires ownership.

Division Two: Limited Rights in rem
Title Twenty-One: Easements and Real Burdens
Chapter One: Easements
Art. 730
1 A parcel of land may be encumbered in favour of another property
such that the servient owner must permit the owner of the dominant
property to exercise certain rights over it to or may not exercise certain of the rights attaching to his or her property for the benefit of the
owner of the dominant property.
2 An obligation to carry out certain acts may only be accessory to an
easement. Any person acquiring the dominant or servient property is
only bound by such an obligation if it is based on an entry in the land
register.543
Art. 731
1 An easement is created by entry in the land register.
2 The provisions governing land ownership apply to the acquisition or
registration of an easement, except where otherwise provided.
3 Adverse possession of an easement is possible only in respect of
parcels of land which may be possessed adversely.
Art. 732544
1 The legal transaction creating an easement is only valid if done as a
public deed.
2 If in the circumstances the exercise of the easement is limited to part
of the dominant property and if the geographical location is not sufficiently identifiable in the certificate of legal title, it must be shown in
a diagram in an extract of the plan for the land register.
Art. 733
The owner of a property may create an easement on a property in
favour of another property which he or she also owns.

Art. 734
An easement is extinguished with the deletion of its registration or the
complete loss of either the servient or the dominant property.
Art. 735
1 If the beneficiary of an easement becomes the servient owner, he or
she may have the easement deleted from the land register.
2 If it is not deleted, the easement remains in place as a right in rem.
Art. 736
1 If an easement is of no value to the dominant property, the servient
owner may request its deletion.
2 If the dominant property still derives a benefit from the easement but
this is minor and disproportionate to the encumbrance, the easement
may be partly or wholly cancelled in return for compensation.
Art. 737
1 The beneficiary is entitled to take all measures necessary to preserve
and exercise the easement.
2 However, he or she is obliged to exercise his or her rights as benignly as possible.
3 The servient owner must not do anything to obstruct the exercise of
the easement or render it more difficult.
Art. 738
1 The land register entry for an easement defines the scope of the
easement, provided it clearly indicates the attendant rights and duties.
2 Within the limits of such entry, the scope of the easement may be
inferred from the reason for its creation or from the fact that it has
been exercised unchallenged and in good faith for some length of
time.
Art. 739
Additional encumbrances may not be imposed on the servient owner if
the needs of the dominant property change.

Art. 740a545
1 If two or more beneficiaries benefit from common fixtures based on
the same easement and if no other agreement exists, the provisions
applicable to co-owners apply by analogy.
2 The right to leave the community by waiving the easement may be
excluded for a maximum of 30 years by agreement in the form specified for the easement agreement. The agreement may be noted in the
land register.
Art. 741
1 The beneficiary is responsible for maintaining any fixtures required
for the exercise of an easement.
2 If the fixture also serves the interests of the servient owner, both
parties are responsible for its maintenance in proportion to their interests. An alternative arrangement is binding on the acquirer of the
dominant and the acquirer of the servient property if there is proof
thereof in the land register.546
Art. 742
1 If only part of a property is affected by the exercise of an easement,
the servient owner is entitled, provided he or she can show a legitimate interest and bears the cost, to request that the right be transferred
to another location which is no less suitable for the beneficiary.
2 He or she is entitled to do so even if the easement is recorded in the
land register as being in a specific location.

Art. 748
1 Usufruct is extinguished in the event of the complete loss of the
object to which it applies and in the case of immovable property on
deletion of the entry from the land register where the entry was required to establish the usufruct.
2 Other grounds for extinction, such as the passage of time or the
renunciation or death of the usufructuary, confer on the owner only a
right to apply for the deletion of the entry.
3 A statutory usufruct ends on cessation of its cause.
Art. 749
1 Usufruct ceases with the death of the usufructuary and in the case of
legal entities on their dissolution.
2 In the case of legal entities, however, it may not last more than 100
years.
Art. 750
1 The owner of the object of a usufruct is not obliged to replace or
restore the object if it has been destroyed.
2 If it is replaced or restored the usufruct is restored with it.
3 If an object that has been destroyed is replaced, as may be the case
with compulsory purchase and insurance indemnities, the usufruct
continues on the replacement object.
Art. 751
When the usufruct ends, the person in possession of the object must
return it to the owner.
Art. 752
1 The usufructuary is liable for complete loss or deterioration of the
object, unless he or she shows that he or she was not at fault.
2 He or she must replace any items which have been used up if such
consumption is not intrinsic to the use of the object.
3 He or she is not obliged to compensate for any depreciation caused
by the proper use of the object.

the usufructuary’s right to compensation for expenditure or to remove
fixtures are limited to one year after the return of the object.
Art. 755

the object.
2 He or she is responsible for looking after it.
3 In the exercise of these rights, he or she must exercise reasonable
care.
Art. 756
1 Natural fruits belong to the usufructuary if they have ripened during
the period of the usufruct.
2 The person who has cultivated the land is entitled to claim equitable
compensation for his or her costs from the person who receives the
ripe fruits, whereby this compensation should not exceed their value.
3 Constituent parts of the usufruct other than fruits or produce belong
to the owner.
Art. 757
Interest on usufructuary capital and other periodic returns accrue to
the usufructuary from the day on which the usufruct begins until the
day on which it ends, even if they mature at a later date.

Art. 760
1 The owner is entitled to request security from the usufructuary
providing he or she may show that his or her rights are jeopardised.
2 He or she is entitled to request security without such showing and
already before transfer where consumable objects or securities are the
object of the usufruct.
3 If securities are the object of the usufruct, their deposit constitutes
sufficient security.
Art. 761
1 A person who has transferred an object as a gift while reserving a
personal right of usufruct may not be required to provide security.
2 The obligation to provide security in the case of statutory usufruct is
subject to the specific rules governing the legal relationship.
Art. 762
If the usufructuary fails to provide security within the reasonable time
limit set for that purpose, or if he or she persists in using the object
unlawfully despite the owner’s objections, the court may dispossess
him or her of the object until further notice and appoint a trustee.
Art. 763
The owner and the usufructuary have the right at any time to request
that a publicly notarised inventory of the objects subject to the usufruct be drawn up at their joint expense.
Art. 764
1 The usufructuary must preserve the object in its original condition
and of his or her own accord carry out such repairs and renovations as
constitute normal maintenance.

taxes and other duties for the duration of his or her rights over the
object.
2 If the taxes and duties are payable by the owner, the usufructuary
must compensate him or her to the same extent.
3 All other charges are borne by the owner, but if the usufructuary
does not advance the owner the necessary funds on request, he or she
is entitled to dispose of parts of the usufruct for this purpose.
Art. 766
In the case of a usufruct of assets, the usufructuary must pay interest
on the debts but, where justified in the circumstances, is entitled on
request to be released from that obligation by redemption of the debt
so that afterwards the usufruct is confined to the remainder of the
assets.
Art. 767
1 The usufructuary must insure the object in favour of the owner
against fire and other risks to the extent such insurance is required
under the duty of care required by local custom.
2 Where this is the case, and also where a usufruct is established on an
already insured object, the usufructuary bears the costs of the insurance for the duration of the usufruct.
Art. 768

Art. 770
1 The usufructuary of woodland is entitled to farm it within the limits
of a reasonable business plan.
2 Both owner and usufructuary may require compliance with a plan
which takes due account of their rights.
3 Where there is large-scale loss of woodland caused by storm, snow,
fire, insect infestation or other factors, either the exploitation must
gradually be reduced or the business plan adapted to the changed
circumstances; income realised from the clearing of timber must be
invested at interest and serves as compensation for the loss of woodland.
Art. 771
The provisions governing the usufruct of woodland apply mutatis
mutandis to the usufruct of objects, such as mines, whose use involves
the extraction of substances from the earth.
Art. 772
1 In the absence of an agreement to the contrary, the usufructuary
becomes the owner of consumable objects but is liable to replace the
value they had at the beginning of the usufruct.
2 Where any other chattels which have been valued are transferred to
the usufructuary he or she may, in the absence of an agreement to the
contrary, freely dispose of them but is liable for their replacement if he
or she exercises such right.
3 Agricultural equipment, herds of animals, stores of goods and the
like may be replaced with objects of the same kind and quality.
Art. 773
1 A usufruct of debts entitles the usufructuary to retain the realised
revenue.
2 Notices of termination to the debtor and dispositions relating to
securities subject to a usufruct must be made jointly by the creditor
and the usufructuary; notices of termination by the debtor must be
addressed to both.
3 If a debt is at risk, the creditor and the usufructuary have a mutual
right to request each other’s consent to such measures as are required
to ensure diligent administration.

Art. 775
1 The usufructuary has the right to request the assignment of the debts
and securities over which he or she has a usufruct within three months
of the beginning thereof.
2 Once assignment has been effected, he or she is liable to the former
creditor for the value of the debts and securities as at the date of
assignment and is required to provide security for that amount unless
waived by the creditor.
3 If the creditor has not waived his or her right to security, the assignment becomes effective only once security has been posted.
Art. 776
1 The right of residence is the right to live in all or part of a building.
2 It is neither transferable nor heritable.
3 It is subject to the provisions governing usufruct unless the law
provides otherwise.
Art. 777
1 The scope of the right of residence is generally tailored to the personal requirements of the usufructuary.
2 However, unless the right is expressly restricted to the person of the
holder, he or she may share the residence with his or her family and
household.
3 If the right of residence is limited to part of a building, the holder
may use the fittings and installations intended for common use.

1 Immovable property may be encumbered with an easement entitling
a third party to erect or maintain a construction above or below ground
on such land.

3 If the building right has the character of a distinct and permanent
right it may be recorded in the land register as immovable property.
Art. 779a554
1 The legal transaction creating a building right is only valid if done as
a public deed.
2 If the remuneration for the building right and any other contractual
provisions should be noted in the land register, they are also only valid
if done as a public deed.
Art. 779b555
1 Contractual provisions on the nature and scope of a building right,
such as location, design, size and purpose of the buildings, as well as
on the use of land which, although not built on, is used in the exercise
of the building right, are binding on every new owner of the right and
the servient property.
2 Additional contractual provisions may be noted in the land register,
if the parties so agree.557
Art. 779c558
When the building right expires, any existing construction reverts to
the landowner and becomes an integral part of his or her parcel of

Art. 827
1 If the property owner is not the debtor of the secured debt, he or she
may redeem the mortgage on the same conditions as the debtor may
repay the debt.
2 If he or she satisfies the creditor, the claim passes to him or her.
Art. 828
1 Where a property is mortgaged for more than its value in respect of
debts for which the acquirer is not personally liable, and providing no
debt enforcement proceedings are pending, cantonal law may authorise the acquirer to redeem the mortgage rights either by paying the
purchase price to the creditors or, where the property was acquired
without payment, the amount at which he or she values the property.
2 He or she must give the creditors six months’ notice in writing of his
or her intention to redeem the mortgage.
3 The redemption amount is distributed among the creditors according
to their rank.
Art. 829
1 Within one month of the acquirer’s notification, the creditors are
entitled to request that the mortgaged property be sold at public auction provided that they advance the costs, such auction to be announced publicly and held within one month of the date on which it
was requested.

mortgage is redeemed at that higher price.
3 The costs of the public auction are borne by the acquirer if a higher
price is obtained, or otherwise by the creditor who requested the
auction.
Art. 830
Cantonal law may provide that the redemption amount be determined

Art. 832
1 The alienation of a mortgaged property does not affect liability under
the mortgage contract and of the debtor unless otherwise agreed.
2 However, if the new owner has assumed liability for the secured
debt, the previous debtor is discharged unless the creditor notifies him
or her in writing within one year that he or she intends to retain him or
her as debtor.
Art. 833
1 If part of a mortgaged property or one of two or more mortgaged
properties belonging to the same owner is alienated or if the mortgaged property is divided, unless otherwise agreed, liability under the
mortgage will be reallocated in proportion to the value of the different
parts.
2 If the creditor does not wish to accept such reallocation, within one
month of its becoming final he or she may request repayment of his or
her debt within one year.
3 Where the new owners have assumed liability for the debts secured
by their properties, the previous debtor is discharged unless the creditor notifies him or her in writing within one year that he or she intends
to retain him or her as debtor.

no longer be cited in opposition to third parties who rely on the land
register in good faith.
3 More restrictive regulations under cantonal law are reserved.
Art. 837587
1 The right to establish a statutory mortgage right applies to:
1. the vendor’s claim to the sale price;
2. the claims of co-heirs and other co-owners in undivided shares
arising from the division of immovable property which belonged to the community;
3. the claims of tradesmen and building contractors who have
supplied labour and materials, or labour alone, for construction or other works, for demolition work, scaffolding work or
for securing the construction pit or similar on the property
whether the debtor is the owner of the property, tradesman or
building contractor, tenant or any other person with rights to
the property.
2 If a tenant or other person with rights to the property is liable for
debts due to tradesmen or building contractors, the claim is valid only
if the property owner has consented to the work being done.
3 The beneficiary may not waive such statutory mortgage rights in
advance.
Art. 838
A lien in favour of the vendor, co-heirs or co-owners in undivided
shares must be registered within three months of transfer of ownership.
Art. 839588
1 A tradesman's or building contractor’s lien may be recorded in the

3 The lien is entered only if the claim has been acknowledged by the
owner or confirmed in a court judgment and may not be requested if
the owner provides the claimant with adequate security.
4 If the property is indisputably administrative assets and if the owner's liability for the debt is not based on contractual obligations, the
owner shall be liable to the tradesmen or building contractor for debts
that are acknowledged or determined by a court in accordance with the
provisions on a debt subject to a simple surety, provided a written
claim for the debt making reference to the statutory surety was made
against the owner no later than four months after completion of the
work.
5 If there is a dispute as to whether immovable property constitutes
administrative assets, the tradesman or building contractor may apply
for the provisional recording of the lien in the land register no later
than four months after completion of the work.
6 If it is held in a court judgment that the immovable property constitutes administrative assets, the provisional recording of the lien must
be deleted. It shall be replaced by the statutory surety provided the
requirements of paragraph 4 are met. The deadline is met with the
provisional recording of the lien.
Art. 840
If more than one statutory building contractor’s lien is recorded in the
land register, such liens confer an equal entitlement to satisfaction
from the mortgaged property even if the entries were made on different dates.
Art. 841
1 Where the claims of tradesmen and building contractors are not
wholly satisfied by foreclosure, the shortfall must be compensated for
by the higher-ranking creditors out of such portion of the proceeds as
exceeds the land value, provided it is apparent to such creditors that
their liens have encumbered the property to the detriment of the
tradesmen and building contractors.
2 If the higher-ranking creditor alienates his or her mortgage security,
he or she must compensate the tradesmen and building contractors for
any sum of which they are deprived by such alienation.
3 Once an interested party has had the beginning of the work noted in
the land register, until the time limit for registration has expired, liens
may only be registered in the form of mortgage contracts.

Division Three: Possession and the Land Register
Title Twenty-Four: Possession
Art. 919
1 Effective control over a thing constitutes possession of it.
2 In the case of easements and real burdens, effective exercise of the
right constitutes possession.
Art. 920
1 Where the possessor transfers an object to a third party in order to
confer on him or her a limited right in rem or a personal right, both are
considered to have possession.
2 The owner of the object has direct possession and any other possessor has derivative possession.
Art. 921
Possession is not lost if the exercise of effective control is impeded or
interrupted by occurrences of a temporary nature.
Art. 922
1 Possession is transferred by the delivery of the object itself or of the
means by which the recipient may gain effective control of it.
2 Transfer is complete once the transferee is able to exercise effective
control over the object with the consent of the prior possessor.
Art. 923
Transfer among persons who are absent is completed on delivery of
the object to the transferee or his or her representative.
Art. 924
1 Possession of an object may be acquired without physical delivery if
a third party or the transferor himself retains possession of it in terms
of a special legal relationship.
2 The transfer is not binding on the third party who retains possession
of the object until he or she has been notified thereof by the transferor.
3 The third party is entitled to refuse delivery to the acquirer for the
same reasons for which he or she could have refused delivery to the
transferor.

Art. 925
1 Delivery of documents of title to goods which have been consigned
to a carrier or a warehouse is equivalent to the delivery of the goods
themselves.
2 However, where a bona fide acquirer of the document of title to
goods is in conflict with a bona fide acquirer of the goods, the latter
has priority.
Art. 926
1 A possessor has the right to use force in self-defence against any
unlawful interference.
2 If he or she has been dispossessed of an object by force or by clandestine means, he or she has the right to recover it immediately by
expelling the trespasser from the property or, in the case of a chattel,
by taking it from a person caught in the act and pursued immediately.
3 In doing so, he or she must abstain from all force not justified by the
circumstances.
Art. 927
1 A person who wrongfully dispossesses another of an object is
obliged to return it, even if he or she claims a better right to it.
2 If the defendant may immediately show a better right entitling him or
her to reclaim the object from the claimant, he or she may refuse to
return it.
3 The claim is for restitution of the object plus damages.
Art. 928
1 A possessor disturbed by trespass may bring an action against the
trespasser even if the latter claims to be in the right.
2 The claim is for cessation of trespass, prohibition of further trespass
and damages.
Art. 929
1 An action for restitution or trespass lies only provided the possessor
sues for restitution of the object or for cessation of trespass immediately upon becoming aware of the interference in his or her rights and
the identity of the trespasser.
2 The action prescribes one year after the date of the trespass or dispossession even if the claimant did not become aware of the interference in his or her rights and the identity of the trespasser until a later
date.

invoke the presumption that the person from whom he or she received

a personal right, the existence of such a right is presumed, but such
presumption cannot be invoked against the person from whom the
possessor received the chattel.
Art. 932
The possessor of a chattel may invoke the presumption of his or her
better right in any action brought against him, subject to the provisions
governing wrongful dispossession or trespass.
Art. 933
A person who takes possession of a chattel in good faith in order to
become its owner or to acquire a limited right in rem is protected
therein even if the chattel was entrusted to the transferor without any
authority to effect the transfer.
Art. 934
1 A possessor whose chattel has been stolen or lost, or who has otherwise been dispossessed of it against his or her will, may reclaim it
from any possessor within a period of five years. Article 722 is reserved.599

her presumed right.

3 As long as a possessor does not know to whom he or she must surrender the object, he or she is only liable for damage for which he or
she is at fault.
Art. 941

beneficiary that it will delete the entry unless he or she files an objection with land registry within 30 days.
Art. 976b631
1 If the beneficiary files an objection, the land registry shall reassess
the request for deletion at the request of the encumbered person.

3 Rights in rem registered under the previous law in public books
shall, provided they may be created under the new law, be entered ex
officio in the land register.
Art. 44
1 Rights in rem under the previous law that are not registered remain
valid but may not be cited in opposition to third parties who rely in
good faith on the land register.
2 The Confederation or the cantons may however enact legislation to
have all rights in rem that are not recorded in the land register declared
invalid after a specific date subject to prior notice.
3 Unregistered public law real burdens and statutory liens under cantonal law created before the amendment of 11 December 2009711
comes into force may for a period of ten years from the date on which
the amendment comes into force be cited in opposition to third parties
who rely on the land register in good faith.712
Art. 45713
1 Rights in rem that may no longer be established under the land
register law such as the ownership of trees on another person's land,
liens on usufructs and suchlike are not recorded in the land register but
must be noted in an appropriate manner.
2 If such rights have lapsed for whatever reason, they may not be reestablished.
Art. 46
1 The introduction of the land register in accordance with the provisions of this Code may be postponed by the cantons with the authorisation of the Federal Council provided the cantonal provisions on
forms of notice, with or without amendments appear to be sufficient to
guarantee the effects that the new law requires of the land register.
2 The forms of notice under cantonal law that are intended to guarantee the effects required by the new law must be precisely specified.

Art. 47
The property law under this Code in general comes into force even if
the land registers have not been established.
Art. 48
1 When the property law comes into force and before the introduction
of the land register, the cantons may designate the procedures, such
those for drawing up documents or registration in the registers for
land, liens and servitudes, that will immediately have the effect of
being recorded in the land register.
2 Even without or before the introduction of the land register, it may
be provided that these procedures have the same effect as being recorded in the land register in the case of the creation, transfer, modification and extinction of rights in rem.
3 However, in the event that the land register itself is not introduced or
another equivalent institution established, these procedures do not
have the same effect as being recorded in the land register in relation
to third parties relying thereon in good faith.
Art. 49
1 Where a prescriptive period of five or more years is introduced, the
part of a prescriptive period that has elapsed before this Code comes
into force is taken into account, whereby however at least two years
must elapse from this date in order to complete the prescriptive period.
2 Shorter periods established by this Code for prescription or the
expiry of rights begin to run only when this Code comes into force.
3 Otherwise, prescription is governed from that date by the provisions
of the new law.
Art. 50
Contracts concluded before this Code comes into force remain valid
even if their form is not in accordance with the provisions of the new
law.
